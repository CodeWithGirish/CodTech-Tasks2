**Key Features:**

**Add Product:** Provides users with the ability to enter new products' names, prices, and quantities into the inventory database.

**Update Product:** This feature enables you to alter current product details right from the graphical user interface.

**Delete Product:** Enables easy data management by offering the ability to remove products from the inventory database.

**Examine Product:** provides an extensive inventory of all products that are currently kept in the database, making inventory management simple.

**Search Product:** This feature improves accessibility and efficiency by enabling users to look for particular products by name or other parameters.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Made with Swing, this interface provides easy-to-use navigation and operation.

**Database Integration:** JDBC provides smooth connectivity and effective data operations, while MySQL is used to store and manage product data.

**Conclusion:**
This project implements a comprehensive Inventory Management System using Java and MySQL. The system allows users to add, update, delete, view, and search products through a graphical user interface developed with Swing. Data is stored persistently in a MySQL database using JDBC for seamless connectivity and data operations. Key features include:

Add Product: Ability to add new products with details such as name, cost, and quantity.
Update Product: Modify existing product information directly from the interface.
Delete Product: Remove products from the inventory database.
View Product: Display all products currently stored.
Search Product: Find products by name or other criteria.

The project is developed using IntelliJ IDEA. It serves as a practical demonstration of Java application development, GUI implementation with Swing, and database integration using JDBC.
